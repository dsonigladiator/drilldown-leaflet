We are given n hierarchical geojson files

We want to establish hierarchy relationships between each pair of parent-child layer

relations = {} //this will contain all relation objects for all pairs of parent-child layers (n objects)

// generating relationships (it is a one time thing)

for parent_feature in parent_layer:
    
    for child_feature in child_layer:
        
        parent_layer-child_layer-relation = {}
        
        centroid = getCentroid(child_feature)
        
        // find all child_feature belonging to current parent_feature
        
        if (turf.booleanPointInPolygon(centroid, parent_feature)) {
            
            push {parent_feature, child_feature} to parent_layer-child_layer-relation object

        }

// once relationships have been established, we can show the first layer on the map

// drill down generic

function drillDown(e) {

    var current_feature = get the current feature using e.sourceTarget.feature
    
    find current_feature as a key in relationships object, it should return all the children of this current_feature in an array or something

    remove everything from map

    display the fetched child features on the map

}


// drill up generic

function drillUp(e) {

    remove currrent layer

    display parent layer

    fit map to bounds of parent layer

}

We have two buttons "drill-down" and "drill-up", so bind the click event listeners to these buttons and call drillDown() and drillUp on these buttons respectively.

But to drillDown, we need to know the current
