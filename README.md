# drilldown-leaflet
Contains code for drill up and drill down functionality in leaflet

Current Status:
- End to end drill down and drill up is working as expected
- Edge cases such as no drill down further than bottom most layer and no drill up further than top most layer have been taken care of
- Drill up filtering needs to be sorted out (might require some hard coding for middle layers in layer hierarchy)
